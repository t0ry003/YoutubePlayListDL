Easy YouTube MP3 Downloader Using Python

## How to set it up?
Guide: https://youtu.be/ZTY4R9rv9ZE <br>
Install all the used libs (i assume anyone can do it from the thousands of tutorials out there)!
Install **FFMPEG** from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). If it's still bugging add the bin path to `system variables`

> Thank's for using my scripts! For single song downloader give a star to the prject so I can see it's used!
